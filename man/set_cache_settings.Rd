\item{...}{you can also submit the settings as a named list.}

\item{active}{boolean (optional), set to FALSE to disable caching}

\item{stale}{numeric (optional), the number of days before a cached item is

}
\description{
By default successful requests to \code{SurvStat} are cached for 7 days to prevent
repeated querying of the service. This is stored in the usual R package cache
location by default (e.g. \code{"~/.cache/rsurvstat"} on mac / linux). Caching can
be switched off altogether.
}
\examples{
old_settings = set_cache_settings(active = FALSE)
set_cache_settings(old_settings)
